{"name":"Giphy","tagline":"A Dart wrapper for Giphy's API","body":"[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/mplacona/giphy/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/mplacona/giphy/latest)\r\n\r\n# Giphy API Dart Wrapper\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a wrapper to the Giphy API for Dart. It let's you use Giphy's API in your projects to load up amazong gifs. Who doesn;t like cat's gifs then?\r\n\r\n## Access and API Keys\r\n\r\nThe Giphy API is open to the public. They have instituted a simple, single public beta key system to let anyone try it out. The API key is required for all endpoints. <b>The public beta key is \"dc6zaTOxFJmzC\"</b>.  Please use this key while you develop your application and experiment with your integrations.\r\n\r\nOnce you are ready to use the Giphy API in production, please contact [api@giphy.com](mailto:api@giphy.com) to request a unique API key. In your email please provide the following information:\r\n\r\n- The app name with brief description, web / app store links, etc.\r\n- What is the 'live date' of the app or feature that integrates with the API?\r\n- As per Giphy's section 5 A of their [terms](http://giphy.com/terms), they require all apps that use the Giphy API to conspicuously display \"Powered By Giphy\" attribution marks. You can find approved [official logo marks here](http://giphymedia.s3.amazonaws.com/giphy-api-icons.zip). Please be sure to include a screen shot of your app that includes the attribution.\r\n\r\n<b>Note: the public key is subject to rate limit constraints. Giphy do not encourage live production deployments to use the public key.</b>\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe following JSON endpoints are currently supported:\r\n\r\n+ search [Giphy's document](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint)\r\n+ translate [Giphy's document](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI#translate-endpoint)\r\n+ random [Giphy's document](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI#random-endpoint)\r\n+ trending [Giphy's document](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI#trending-gifs-endpoint)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n\r\nimport 'package:giphy/giphy.dart';\r\n\r\nmain() {\r\n    Giphy giphy = new Giphy(\"dc6zaTOxFJmzC\");\r\n    giphy.trending()\r\n        .then((value) => print(value))\r\n        .catchError((error) => print(error.toString()));\r\n}\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
